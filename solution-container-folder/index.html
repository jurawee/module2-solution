      <p>Corned beef is simply salt-cured beef brisket. While you can go the extra mile and cure your own beef brisket at home, we prefer to take the simpler route and buy our corned beef already cured and ready to go! Making your own corned beef is a multi-day process, and honestly, with a four-to-eight hour cook time (depending on which cooking method you choose) this corned beef and cabbage recipe takes long enough as it is.</p>
